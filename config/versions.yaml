# GenVM Linter Configuration
# Rule configurations for the version-aware linting system
#
# All base validation rules are enabled for all versions and hashes.
# Test rules demonstrate version/hash-specific behavior.

# Active Rules
rules:
  # Base validation rules - always enabled
  base_rules:
    - "magic-comment"       # Validates magic comment and extracts version
    - "import"             # Validates import statements
    - "contract-class"     # Validates contract class structure
    - "decorator"          # Validates method decorators
    - "type-system"        # Validates GenVM type system usage
    - "genvm-api"          # Validates GenVM API usage patterns
    - "lazy-object"        # Validates lazy object usage
    - "storage-pattern"    # Validates storage access patterns
    - "dataclass"          # Validates dataclass usage
    - "nondet-storage"     # Validates non-deterministic storage access
    - "python-types"       # Python type checking integration
    - "type-stub"          # GenVM type stub validation

  # Test rules - demonstrate version/hash-specific capabilities
